### Useful Docker Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop the application
docker compose down

# Rebuild and restart
docker compose up -d --build

- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (none/debug)

Note: Google credentials and logging settings can be managed through the UI in Settings > System. Environment variables will be used as fallback if system settings are not configured.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

| Calendar Management | ✅ | ✅ |
| Task Management | ✅ | ✅ |
| Google Calendar Integration | ✅ | ✅ |
| Outlook Calendar Integration | ✅ | ✅ |
| CalDAV Integration | ✅ | ✅ |
| Billing & Subscription Management | ❌ | ✅ |

### SAAS Development Setup

If you're a contributor to the SAAS version, follow these steps to set up your development environment:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/fluidcalendar/fluidcalendar-saas.git
   ```

2. Enable SAAS features in your environment:
   ```
   # .env.local
   ENABLE_SAAS_FEATURES=true
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Syncing Changes Between Repositories

To sync changes from the private SAAS repository to the public open source repository:

1. Use the provided sync script:
   ```
   ./scripts/sync-repos.sh /path/to/private/repo /path/to/public/repo
   ```

2. Review the changes in the public repository
3. Commit and push the changes to the public repository

### Contributing to SAAS Features

When developing SAAS features:

1. Place all SAAS-specific code in the `src/saas` directory
2. Use the feature flag system to conditionally enable SAAS features
3. Provide fallbacks for SAAS features in the open source version

For more information about contributing to the SAAS version, please contact the maintainers.
