# BUG
- [ ] if i have a bunch of tasks that have isautoscheduled false and i click autoschedule the UI updates with a blank list because no tasks are returned. i have to refresh the page to get the tasks.
- [ ] auto scheduling is creating task in the past (it might be off by one day)
- [ ] auto scheduling did not schedule high priority tasks first
- [ ] save task completed date and sync it with outlook 
- [ ] deleteing a recurring event from quickview doens't work well and doesn't ask me if i want to delete the series or just the instance.
  
## Next Steps
- [ ] Integrate google calendar
