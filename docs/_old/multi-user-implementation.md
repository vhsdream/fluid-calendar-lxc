### Next Steps
1. **Implement Password Reset Functionality**: This is our highest priority now that data isolation is complete.
   - Create password reset request page (`src/app/auth/forgot-password/page.tsx`)
   - Create password reset confirmation page (`src/app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx`)
   - Implement API endpoints for password reset (`src/app/api/auth/forgot-password/route.ts` and `src/app/api/auth/reset-password/route.ts`)
   - Implement email sending functionality for reset links

2. **Implement Email Verification**: This will improve security and user account management.
   - Create email verification page (`src/app/auth/verify-email/page.tsx`)
   - Update registration process to send verification emails
   - Add verification status indicators in the UI
   - Implement API endpoint for email verification (`src/app/api/auth/verify-email/route.ts`)

3. **Consider Making userId Non-Nullable**: Strengthen the database schema for better security.
   - Implement the two-step migration approach outlined below
   - Test thoroughly in development before applying to production

4. **Enhance User Management**: Improve the user administration experience.
   - Complete the user management API (`src/app/api/users/route.ts` and `src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`)
   - Implement user invitation functionality (`src/app/api/invitations/route.ts`)
   - Create email templates for invitations (`src/lib/email/templates/invitation.ts`)

### Implementation Priority
With data isolation and API refactoring complete, we should now focus on:

1. Implementing password reset functionality as the next major feature
2. Adding email verification to enhance security
3. Making userId non-nullable in the database schema with a proper migration strategy
4. Enhancing user management features for administrators

## Data Migration Strategy for Non-Nullable userId
To make userId non-nullable in the database schema, we recommend a two-step migration approach:

1. **First Migration**: 
   - Identify all records without a userId
   - Assign them to the admin user using the existing migrateExistingData function
   - Verify all records have a valid userId

2. **Second Migration**:
   - After confirming all records have a userId, create a Prisma migration to make userId non-nullable
   - Update the schema and run the migration

This approach ensures data integrity while strengthening the database schema for better security.

## Security Considerations
As we move forward with implementing multi-user functionality, we should keep these security considerations in mind:

1. Implement proper CSRF protection
2. Use secure cookies for session management
3. Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
4. Validate all user input
5. Implement proper error handling to avoid information leakage
6. Use HTTPS for all communications
7. Implement proper password hashing and storage
8. Regularly audit authentication and authorization code
9. Ensure system-wide settings (like logs) are only accessible to administrators
